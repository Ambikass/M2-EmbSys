IrDA: IrDA provides specifications for a complete set of protocols for wireless infrared communications, and the name "IrDA" also refers to that set of protocols
The main reason for using the IrDA protocols had been wireless data transfer over the "last one meter" using point-and-shoot principles. Thus, it has been implemented in portable devices such as mobile telephones, laptops, cameras, printers, and medical devices. The main characteristics of this kind of wireless optical communication are physically secure data transfer, line-of-sight (LOS) and very low bit error rate (BER) that makes it very efficient.

RS232: In telecommunications, RS-232 is a standard for serial communication transmission of data. It formally defines the signals connecting between a DTE (data terminal equipment) such as a computer terminal, and a DCE (data circuit-terminating equipment or data communication equipment), such as a modem.It is a 3 wire unblanced line and used for data transmission over short distances.

Ethernet: An Ethernet camera sends the small packets of data to the monitor, which converts the data into an image. Ethernet technology allows Stoneridge-Orlaco's HD-E cameras, for example, to send the image to one or more monitors over a network.

USB: USB stands for 'Universal Serial Bus' and is a form of data connection and transfer protocol. The data input/output port on most modern cameras is a type of USB port and USB ports can be found on nearly all modern computers.

Mic: A Mic, or Microphone is a device designed to capture and convert sound into a digital signal so that it can be recorded to a storage medium.

DRAM: DRAM is widely used in digital electronics where low-cost and high-capacity memory is required. One of the largest applications for DRAM is the main memory (called the “RAM”) in modern computers and graphics cards (where the “main memory” is called the graphics memory).

Flash Memory: It is a type of nonvolatile memory that erases data in units called blocks and rewrites data at the byte level. It is widely used for storage and data transfers in consumer devices, industrial applications. Flash memory is a non-volatile computer storage chip, It is made up of EEPROM.

Processor: An image processor, also known as an image processing engine, image processing unit (IPU), or image signal processor (ISP), is a type of media processor or specialized digital signal processor (DSP) used for image processing, in digital cameras or other devices.
