The washing machine concept is pretty simple , it agitates your clothes in a soapy suds and water to remove any dirt and stains before spinning to drain the water after the cycle. The main components of a washing machine is the drum, which fills up with water, but did you know that washing machines actually have two drums, not one? Your average washing machine is made up of: 

An inner drum: This is where you put the clothes when you’re ready to wash. You’ll notice this drum rotates a bit when you touch it and there are a lot of holes punched into the drum. These allow the water to come in and wash the clothes. 

Paddles: These are ridges that lie on the edge of the drum and help move your clothes around while being washed. 

Agitator: These are more common in top load machines and is a paddle in the middle that helps turn the clothes around in the soapy water. 

The outer drum: This is not obvious when you look inside the washer, but there is another drum that holds the water while the inner drum or agitator rotates. This part is completely water tight to prevent your machine from leaking all over the bathroom or kitchen! 

Thermostat and heating element: These control the temperature of the water and heats up the water to the specified temperature. 

Pump: This removes the water from the drum after the wash. 

Programmer: This controls the washing machine through all the steps from washing to rinsing and spin drying. 

Pipes and valves: These allow the water in and out of the washer.
