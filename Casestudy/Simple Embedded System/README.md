### Components:

1.Arduino UNO R3
Arduino is an open source physical processing platform that includes a microcontroller board and a development environment for programming the board. It receives a few inputs, such as switches or sensors, and monitors a few numerous outputs, such as lights, the engine, and so on.
In contrast to most microcontroller frameworks, Arduino is a cross-platform app since its programmes may run on Windows, Macintosh, and Linux operating systems (OS).

2.GSM Module
It's a module for cellular communication. It stands for worldwide mobile communication system. The GSM Module is made up of three parts: a mobile station, a base station, and a network subsystem.
The GSM Module is utilised to deliver SMS notifications and also assists the user in overriding the system manually.

3.Flying Fish MH Sensor
This is a very inexpensive analogue board with a comparator and a pot that outputs both analogue and digital (threshold) signals.

4.Relay Module
This is a 2-channel 5V, 10A relay interface board. It's possible.
used to manage a variety of appliances and other devices
a strong current

5.DC Motor
Any of a group of rotating electrical machines that transform direct current electrical energy into mechanical energy is known as a DC motor. The most common varieties rely on magnetic fields to produce forces.
Two DC motors were used to provide two pumps for water flow.

6.Water Level Sensing Circuit
A water level sensor circuit was constructed using an Arduino UNO, two 10 kilo-ohm resistors, a bread board, jumper wires, and a 5V DC supply. It's used to check the amount of water in a tank.

### Requirements

#### High level requirements

* One of the most significant features is irrigation.
* Crop irrigation schedule on a daily basis.
* It irrigates at various levels of wetness.
* It conserves water.
* The complete irrigation system is controlled via a smartphone.

#### Low Level Requirements
* The system will automatically activate when the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold.
* When the crop requires water, the system will provide it.
* The system measures the moisture content of the soil using the soil moisture level sensor.
* The water level is also checked by the system.
