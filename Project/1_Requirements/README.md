# Abstract

Traditional home security systems frequently necessitate installation and detect intrusion based on the opening and closing of doors and windows. Our ultrasonic security system will come in useful in situations where installation is not possible and/or the area of interest has no door because it does not require installation and identifies intruders based on their physical presence.
