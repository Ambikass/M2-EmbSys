# Components 

## Micro controller
A microcontroller is a miniature computer built on a single MOS integrated circuit chip. A microcontroller is a computer that contains one or more CPUs , memory, and programmable input/output peripherals.Microcontrollers are utilised in products and devices that are automatically operated, such as car engine control systems, implantable medical devices, remote controls, office machinery, appliances, power tools, toys, and other embedded systems.


## Ultrasonic sensor

An ultrasonic sensor is a piece of electronic equipment that produces ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal in order to detect the distance between a target item and the sensor.


## Servo motor

A servo motor is a self-contained electrical device that rotates machine parts with high precision and efficiency.


## LCD 

LCD is a display and LCD's have a backlight, and pixels are turned on and off electronically by rotating polarised light with liquid crystals.

## ADC

Only analogue voltage values can be converted into digital values by an ADC. So, whatever parameter we want to monitor, it must first be translated into voltage, which may be accomplished with the help of sensors.


## Potentiometer

A potentiometer is a voltage divider that consists of a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or revolving contact. Potentiometers are often used to operate electrical devices.
