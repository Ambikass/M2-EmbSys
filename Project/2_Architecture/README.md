# Components 

## Micro controller
A microcontroller is a miniature computer built on a single MOS integrated circuit chip. A microcontroller is a computer that contains one or more CPUs , memory, and programmable input/output peripherals.Microcontrollers are utilised in products and devices that are automatically operated, such as car engine control systems, implantable medical devices, remote controls, office machinery, appliances, power tools, toys, and other embedded systems.
In this project microcontroller is used to interface all the periferals.


## Ultrasonic sensor

An ultrasonic sensor is a piece of electronic equipment that produces ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal in order to detect the distance between a target item and the sensor.
In this project ultrasonic sensor is used to sense the object moment.


## Servo motor

A servo motor is a self-contained electrical device that rotates machine parts with high precision and efficiency.
In this project servo motor is used to allow the sensor to move and cover 360-degree


## LCD 

LCD is a display and LCD's have a backlight, and pixels are turned on and off electronically by rotating polarised light with liquid crystals.
In this project LCD is used to display the distance from the sensor to the object.

## ADC

Only analogue voltage values can be converted into digital values by an ADC. So, whatever parameter we want to monitor, it must first be translated into voltage, which may be accomplished with the help of sensors.
In this project ADC is used to covert sensor data to digital data
