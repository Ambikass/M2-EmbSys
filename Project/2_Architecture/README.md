# Components 

## Arduino UNO

* The Arduino/Genuino Uno microcontroller board is based on the ATmega328P microcontroller. There are 14 digital input/output pins (six of which can be used as PWM outputs), six analogue inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button on the board.
* In this project an arduino uno is used to interface all the peripherals.


## Ultrasonic sensor

* An ultrasonic sensor is a piece of electronic equipment that produces ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal in order to detect the distance between a target item and the sensor.
* In this project an ultrasonic sensor is used to sense the object .


## Servo motor

* A servo motor is a self-contained electrical device that rotates machine parts with high precision and efficiency.
* In this project servo motor is used to allow the sensor to move and cover 180-degree


## LCD 

* LCD is a display and LCD's have a backlight, and pixels are turned on and off electronically by rotating polarized light with liquid crystals.
* In this project LCD is used to display the distance from the sensor to the object.


## ADC

* Only analogue voltage values can be converted into digital values by an ADC. So, whatever parameter we want to monitor, it must first be translated into voltage, which may be accomplished with the help of sensors.
* In this project ADC is used to convert sensor data to digital data. 


## Potentiometer

* A potentiometer is a voltage divider that consists of a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or revolving contact.It operates as a variable resistor or rheostat when only two terminals, one end and the wiper, are employed.
* In this project potentiometer is used to act like an object for the ultrasonic sensor.


## Buzzer

* It is an electric signaling device that makes a buzzing sound.
* In this project the buzzer is used to alert the user.
