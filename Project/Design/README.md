# Components 

## Arduino Uno

The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microprocessor.  The board has a number of digital and analogue input/output (I/O) pins that can be used to connect to different expansion boards (shields) and other circuits.


## Ultrasonic sensor

An ultrasonic sensor is a piece of electronic equipment that produces ultrasonic sound waves and converts the reflected sound into an electrical signal in order to detect the distance between a target item and the sensor.


## Servo motor

A servo motor is a self-contained electrical device that rotates machine parts with high precision and efficiency.


## LCD 

LCD is a display and LCD's have a backlight, and pixels are turned on and off electronically by rotating polarised light with liquid crystals.


## Potentiometer

A potentiometer is a voltage divider that consists of a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or revolving contact. Potentiometers are often used to operate electrical devices.
